# Introduction To Deep Learning

This repo includes all the example codes and data set used in my book 'Introduction to Deep Learning'. The purpose of this book is to document my teachings in a physical form and make it accessible for students with limited resources to learn from. The book aims to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-follow introduction to the fundamental concepts of deep methods. 

I believe that hands-on learning is crucial for understanding and thus, the explanations in the book are accompanied by detailed ’Python code’ snippets throughout the text. The readers can follow the structions and run the code in this Repo on their own computer or an online platform such as Google Colab.
